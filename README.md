# Intro

This project was made with the following particularities: 

  => I have used the youtube-player module. It is true that I could have used an iframe to insert the videos, but I thought it was a nice touch to implement one of Angular's lattest features such as this. 

  => I have also used the Youtube API in order to get the title and the thumbnail of the videos. 

  => I have respected the component tree that was specified in the instructions. I would have added new components (such as video-item for the history list) but I wanted to keep it true to the specifications. 

  => I have used bootstrap to aligning purposes, but it hasn't been used in any other way. 

  => Some tests have been made, but the testing part is far from completed.
